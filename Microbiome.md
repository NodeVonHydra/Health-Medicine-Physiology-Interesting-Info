# Microbiome  
## Gut works independently of the central nervous system (CNS)   
   
- it has its own nervous system called the **enteric nervous system (ENS)**, which is often referred to as the “second brain”   
   
   
**What is the Enteric Nervous System?**   
- The **enteric nervous system** consists of about 100 million neurons embedded in the walls of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, extending from the esophagus to the rectum.   
- It contains two main networks, or **plexuses**: the **myenteric plexus** (which controls muscle contractions for gut movement) and the **submucosal plexus** (which regulates digestive enzyme release and blood flow).   
   
   
**Cutting the connnection **   
- In experiments with animals, researchers have surgically cut the **vagus nerve** (the main pathway for gut-brain communication) to observe how the gut manages without CNS input.   
- Even with the vagus nerve severed, the gut continued to perform essential functions, like peristalsis, nutrient absorption, and secretion of digestive enzymes.   
   
**Pain**   
- the gut feel only pressure and dilation and you can cut it without causing pain (e.g. biopsy without anesthesia)   
   
   
## Autism and Food Allergies   
- **Food Sensitivities and Allergies:** Children with autism show higher rates of food allergies and sensitivities, particularly to gluten, casein, and soy.    
- **GI Issues and Sensory Sensitivities:** Constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are more common in individuals with autism, with sensory sensitivities often intensifying these symptoms.    
- **Gut-Brain Axis and Inflammation:** Higher gut inflammation in some individuals with autism may influence brain function, potentially through the gut-brain axis. This inflammatory response could trigger or worsen behavioral symptoms like irritability and focus issues.   
- **Microbiome Links:** Research suggests autistic individuals may have unique gut microbiome compositions, with bacterial imbalances potentially contributing to GI issues and behavioral changes.   
   
   
## How to detect leaky gut (albumi and trypsin)   
   
1. **Low Albumin (Serum)**:   
- Albumin, a protein produced in the liver, is vital for maintaining oncotic pressure and fluid balance. Low serum albumin often indicates either poor protein absorption or protein loss, both of which can be linked to leaky gut.   
- In leaky gut, proteins can escape into the gut lumen, leading to protein-losing enteropathy, a condition where proteins are lost through the gut lining.   
- Additionally, chronic inflammation can lead to albumin breakdown or reduced synthesis in the liver, leading to low serum albumin levels.   
   
2. **High Trypsin (Stool)**:   
- Trypsin is a digestive enzyme that normally breaks down proteins in the small intestine. Elevated levels in the stool can indicate malabsorption or pancreatic enzyme issues, which are common in those with leaky gut.   
- When the gut lining is damaged, enzymes like trypsin may not be absorbed or regulated properly, leading to increased levels being excreted.   
- This unabsorbed trypsin can signal that proteins and nutrients are not being adequately processed, often linked to compromised gut function and permeability issues.   
   
## Fecal transplant   
   
— obézne myši :))))))   
- usually in patients with Clostridioides difficile Infection (CDI) — Clostridioides difficile that fucks up your microbiome   
   
   
## Akkermansia   
   
1. **What is Akkermansia muciniphila?**   
- **Akkermansia muciniphila** is a beneficial bacterium found in the human gut microbiome, particularly in the mucus layer lining the gut   
- It’s known for supporting gut health by breaking down mucus and producing beneficial compounds that help regulate metabolic processes, immune function, and gut integrity.   
   
**2. Surface Protein on Akkermansia muciniphila: Amuc\_1100**   
- **Amuc\_1100** is a protein on the surface of *Akkermansia muciniphila*. Studies show that it can bind to receptors in the gut and stimulate beneficial responses.   
- **TLR2 Receptor Activation**: Specifically, Amuc\_1100 binds to **Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2)**, which is part of the body’s immune system. This receptor plays a role in recognizing microbial patterns and initiating immune responses.   
- **Impact on L Cells and GLP-1**: By binding to TLR2, Amuc\_1100 can activate **L cells** (cells in the gut), which release a hormone called **GLP-1**. GLP-1 helps regulate blood sugar levels and energy metabolism (aj HUberman o tom hovorí, že to zvyšuje satiety — pomáha to zvyšovať aj Matéčko)   
   
**3. What is the P9 Protein?**   
- The **P9 protein** is another molecule associated with *Akkermansia muciniphila*.   
- **Binding to L Cells**: P9 is believed to have a direct interaction with L cells in the gut. This interaction encourages L cells to produce more **GLP-1**, enhancing metabolic benefits.   
   
**4. Understanding GLP-1 and Its Role**   
- **GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1)** is a hormone produced by the gut in response to food intake.   
   
   
- **Functions of GLP-1**:   
    - **Regulates Blood Sugar**: It stimulates the pancreas to release insulin (which lowers blood sugar) and inhibits glucagon release (which would otherwise raise blood sugar).   
    - **Slows Gastric Emptying**: GLP-1 slows the movement of food from the stomach to the intestines, which can make you feel fuller for longer.   
    - **Suppresses Appetite**: It has a role in reducing appetite, which is why GLP-1 agonists are used as a treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes.   
   
**5. What are L Cells?**   
- **L cells** are specialized cells located primarily in the lining of the intestines, particularly in the lower gut.   
- **Function of L Cells**: They play a crucial role in secreting hormones like **GLP-1** and **PYY (peptide YY)**, both of which help manage digestion, blood sugar, and appetite.   
   
   
## Clustrodium butyricum   
   
**Clostridium butyricum** is a species of bacteria that belongs to the genus **Clostridium**. It is a gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium that can produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), particularly **butyrate** and **propionate**, during the fermentation of dietary fibers. Here’s a detailed exploration of its functions and implications for immune response and gut health:   
   
**Key Concepts**   
1. **Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs)**   
- **Butyrate**: This SCFA is crucial for colon health. It serves as an energy source for colonocytes (the cells lining the colon) and has anti-inflammatory properties. Butyrate plays a significant role in maintaining gut barrier integrity and preventing conditions like leaky gut.   
- **Propionate**: While often considered an intermediate in the metabolic pathway to butyrate, propionate also has various beneficial effects, including modulating immune responses and potentially influencing metabolic processes.   
   
2. **Immune Response and ICAM Receptors**   
- **ICAM (Intercellular Adhesion Molecules)**: These are proteins that play a vital role in the immune system, facilitating the adhesion of immune cells to endothelial cells (cells lining the blood vessels) during inflammation. They are involved in the migration of white blood cells from the bloodstream to tissues in response to injury or infection.   
- Clostridium butyricum may influence immune responses through the modulation of ICAM expression, potentially affecting how immune cells interact with the vascular endothelium. This interaction is crucial in inflammatory responses and can influence conditions related to **vascular permeability**, such as **leaky gut**.   
   
3.**Vasodilation**   
- Vasodilation refers to the widening of blood vessels, which increases blood flow. SCFAs, including butyrate and propionate, may have vasodilatory effects that contribute to improved blood circulation and nutrient delivery.   
- The interaction between immune responses, ICAM, and vascular health is crucial, as inflammation can lead to vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels), while healthy immune function and SCFA production can support vasodilation.
