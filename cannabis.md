# Cannabis   
## Anandamide breakdown drugs   
Pfizer developed a drug targeting the breakdown of **anandamide. It** was supposed to relieve anxiety, panin etc., but there were no interesting interrogations :(   
- Anandamide is naturally degraded by an enzyme called **fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)**   
- Drugs that inhibit FAAH or related mechanisms aim to increase the levels of anandamide in the body   
- In addition to FAAH inhibition, researchers have explored targeting **fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) — **FABPs help transport anandamide to FAAH for degradation (by inhibiting FABPs, the breakdown of anandamide can also be reduced, offering an alternative and potentially safer therapeutic pathway)   
   
## THC and Study Disparity   
- disparity between controlled research and practical consumer experiences — due to regulatory constraints, researchers often cannot study modern, higher-potency cannabis directly   
- researchers often use outdated or low-potency cannabis (such as strains with only 5–9% THC, typical of the 1970s or 1980s) in experimental settings, while patients or participants self-reporting on real-world use may consume significantly more potent street cannabis, which now often exceeds 15–20% THC on average   
- Canavan experiment — some studies relied on participants using their own street-acquired cannabis, with researchers collecting observational data or conducting blood tests in a "canavan" parked near the participants' house.   
   
   
## THC, metabolism and more   
When THC is consumed as an **edible**, it undergoes a significantly different metabolic process compared to inhalation via smoking or vaping. This leads to **enhanced potency** of the active compound.   
### **Forms of THC in Smoking vs. Edibles:**   
- **Smoking or Vaping**:   
    - When marijuana is inhaled, the primary psychoactive compound is **delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 THC)**.   
    - This THC rapidly enters the bloodstream through the lungs and reaches the brain, causing effects within minutes.   
- **Edibles**:   
    - When THC is ingested, it is metabolized by the **liver** before entering the bloodstream.   
    - In the liver, delta-9 THC is converted into **11-hydroxy-THC**, a metabolite that is **much more potent and has a longer half-life** than delta-9 THC.   
        - hence the more intense and longer-lasting effects.   
    - Studies suggest that 11-hydroxy-THC can cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than delta-9 THC, resulting in stronger psychoactive effects.   
   
### **Onset and Duration:**   
- **Smoking/Vaping**:   
    - Effects begin within 5–15 minutes and usually peak within an hour, tapering off in 2–3 hours.   
- **Edibles**:   
    - Effects take 30–90 minutes to kick in (due to digestion and liver metabolism) and can last **6–8 hours or more**, with peak effects occurring 2–3 hours after consumption.   
   
   
## THC and fat cell storage   
- **Storage in Fat Cells**:   
    - THC is lipophilic, meaning it binds to fat cells in the body.   
    - When THC is metabolized, it forms inactive byproducts like **THC-COOH**, which are stored in fat tissues.   
- **Release into the Bloodstream**:   
    - During weight loss or exercise, fat stores are broken down to provide energy.   
    - This breakdown can release stored THC metabolites into the bloodstream.   
    - These metabolites can then appear in blood or urine tests, potentially causing a positive result.   
   
   
## THC and Receptors   
### **CB1 Receptors and Their Roles**   
- **Location**:   
    - **Majority on GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons**: CB1 receptors are most abundant on these neurons, where they suppress inhibitory signaling.   
    - **Fewer on glutamatergic (excitatory) neurons**   
- **Function**:   
    - CB1 receptors modulate neurotransmitter release by inhibiting the release of glutamate (excitatory) or GABA (inhibitory).   
    - The balance of excitatory and inhibitory signals determines the behavioral effects of cannabinoids, such as their **anxiolytic (calming)** or **anxiogenic (panic-inducing)** effects.   
   
   
### **Impact of Deleting CB1 Receptors on Glutamate Neurons**   
- **High Feeling**:   
    - Studies suggest that deleting CB1 receptors specifically from **glutamate neurons** prevents the euphoric or “high” effects of cannabinoids in mice.   
    - This indicates that CB1 receptors on glutamatergic neurons are critical for THC’s psychoactive effects, even though these receptors are less abundant than on GABAergic neurons.   
   
   
### **Impact of Deleting CB1 Receptors on GABA Neurons**   
- **High-Dose Anxiogenic Effects**:   
    - At high doses, cannabinoids can cause anxiety or panic (anxiogenic effects). This effect is mediated by CB1 receptors on **GABAergic neurons**.   
    - Deleting CB1 from GABAergic neurons eliminates the anxiogenic effect seen at high doses, suggesting that this pathway is specifically responsible for THC-induced panic.   
   
   
### **Key Insights**   
- **CB1 on glutamate neurons** is essential for the euphoric “high” and anxiolytic effects of cannabinoids.   
- **CB1 on GABA neurons** contributes to the anxiogenic effects at high doses.   
    - The relative activation of these pathways explains the **biphasic dose response**: calming at low doses but anxiety-provoking at high doses.   
- Targeting CB1 on glutamate neurons may enhance the therapeutic benefits (e.g., for anxiety relief) without inducing panic or psychoactive effects.   
- Avoiding overactivation of CB1 on GABAergic neurons may reduce the risk of high-dose side effects.   
   
   
## CBD and targets   
### **CBD’s Primary Targets**   
- **Endocannabinoid Receptors**:   
    - **CB1 and CB2**: CBD has a **low affinity** for these receptors. Instead, it modulates them indirectly:   
        - Inhibits the breakdown of **anandamide**, an endogenous cannabinoid, increasing its levels in the body.   
        - Acts as a “negative allosteric modulator” of CB1, reducing THC’s ability to activate it fully.   
- **TRPV (Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid) Channels**:   
    - CBD binds to **TRPV1**, known as the “capsaicin receptor,” involved in pain perception, inflammation, and temperature regulation.   
- **5-HT1A (Serotonin Receptor)**:   
    - CBD is a **partial agonist** of 5-HT1A, which may explain its anti-anxiety, antidepressant, and neuroprotective effects.   
- **GPR55**:   
    - CBD is an antagonist of **GPR55**, sometimes called the “orphan receptor,” linked to bone density, inflammation, and cancer proliferation.   
   
   
### **CBD and Adenosine**   
- **Adenosine Receptors (A1 and A2A)**:   
    - CBD enhances **adenosine signaling** by inhibiting its reuptake.    
        - (Adenosine is a neuromodulator that promotes relaxation and has **anti-inflammatory** effects. => CAFFEINE IS ADENOSINE ANTAGONIST)   
    - This makes CBD somewhat like an “anti-caffeine” since caffeine blocks adenosine receptors (causing increased alertness). By contrast, CBD’s effects **enhance adenosine signaling**, promoting calmness and potentially aiding in sleep and reducing inflammation.   
   
   
### **Other Effects**   
- **P450 Enzymes**:   
    - CBD inhibits cytochrome **P450 enzymes**, which are critical for metabolizing various drugs. This can lead to interactions with medications by slowing their breakdown.   
- **Ion Channels and Neural Modulation**:   
    - CBD interacts with ion channels like **calcium and sodium channels**, affecting how neurons fire and potentially contributing to its anti-seizure properties.   
   
### **CBD’s Functional Effects**   
- **Anxiolytic and Relaxing**:   
    - Its effects on serotonin (5-HT1A) and adenosine likely contribute to its calming properties.   
- **Anti-Inflammatory and Pain Relief**:   
    - Via TRPV1 activation and adenosine enhancement, CBD helps reduce inflammation and modulate pain perception.   
- **Anti-Seizure**:   
    - FDA-approved for epilepsy (Epidiolex), likely due to its modulation of TRPV1 and calcium channels.   
   
   
## Cannabis and schizophrenia   
### **Cannabis Use and Psychosis**:   
- Cannabis use alone does not cause schizophrenia. However, in individuals genetically predisposed to the condition, it may **trigger the first psychotic episode**.   
- **Risk vs. Causation**:   
    - Studies suggest that cannabis use increases the risk of developing schizophrenia **two to threefold** in vulnerable populations, but it is **not a direct cause**. Most cannabis users do not develop schizophrenia.   
    - we don't see more schizophrenia in countries where there are more pot users :))   
   
   
### **Urban Living and Schizophrenia**   
- **Environmental Stressors**:   
    - Growing up or living in an urban environment is recognized as a significant **risk factor** for schizophrenia. Factors like social isolation, increased stress, or environmental pollutants may contribute to this elevated risk.   
    - Similar to cannabis, urban living doesn’t directly cause schizophrenia but may interact with genetic predispositions to trigger the disorder.   
   
   
### **Cannabis Use in Those with Schizophrenia**   
- **Worsening Symptoms**:   
    - Evidence suggests that cannabis can worsen symptoms in individuals who already have schizophrenia:   
    - **Positive Symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions)**: May become more pronounced due to THC’s psychoactive effects.   
- **Unclear Relationships**:   
    - The relationship is bidirectional and nuanced. For example:   
    - Some individuals may use cannabis to self-medicate for anxiety or negative symptoms of schizophrenia.   
    - Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis, has shown **antipsychotic properties** in some studies, suggesting potential therapeutic applications.   
   
   
### **Individual Susceptibility**   
- **Genetic Factors**:   
    - Genes like **COMT** and **AKT1** have been linked to an increased risk of psychosis with cannabis use. Individuals with these genetic variants may be more vulnerable.   
- **Age of Onset**:   
    - Adolescents and young adults are particularly at risk. Cannabis use during this critical period of brain development may interfere with neural circuits related to emotion regulation and cognition.
