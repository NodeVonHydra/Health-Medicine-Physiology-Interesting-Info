# Stress and Anxiety
- Sympathetic chain changlia - a group of neurons running from the neck to below the navel   
    - Virtually immediately active when startled   
    - When this happens, these neurons release acetylcholine in various places in the body   
    - Acetylcholine is active whenever we move our muscles (yes, even when we bend down for a doughnut)   
    - Tetanus toxin (TeNT), for example, can do this all over the body at the same time   
    - However, there are also postganglionic neurons in the body that respond to acetylcholine and release epinephrine (the equivalent of acetylcholine) in certain organs   
   
   
- Epinephrine behaves in two ways:   
    - The muscles in your legs and heart (which must be active in FoF mode once you're stressed) have a so-called Beta receptor, which directly responds to epinephrine and causes blood vessels to stretch   
    - It also activates other recpetors on organs that we don't "need" when stressed, such as digestion, reproduction; there, in turn, blood vessels constrict   
- Parasympathetic - brain stem, neck and pelvic area   
    - Cranial nerves in the neck and brainstem have an indirect line to some specific facial features (they control pupil dilation, tongue, etc.)   
        - These neurons are also found in the pelvic area and of course control the bladder, genitals. Etc.   
        - But there is no direct line! It has to go from the brain to the spinal cord and from there to the organs   
    - PS has some entrypoints which allow you to push back on the stress response and relax   
   
   
- Sinoatrial node - a small group of neurons in the heart that virtually watches out for blood flow and sends a signal to the morgue that "blood is moving slower through the heart"; the brain then sends a signal back to the heart to speed it up   
    - For inhalation, the heart gets bigger   
    - If you want your heart to beat faster, inhale longer and more forcefully than exhale (it's more about force than length)   
        - Of course, the whole thing works the other way round to shrink the heart as well   
    - Physiological sigh (DOUBLE INHALE + exhale)   
        - So far the fastest method to shut down stress response   
        - Heart rate calms down after 20 to 30 seconds; you don't want it too fast   
        - You can also use it to fall asleep   
   
   
- Tachykinin - internal punishment signal (not doing what you enjoy, not meeting the right people); makes you more paranoid and anxious
