# Cholesterol - Norwitz and LMHR   
You don't see increase in triglycerides because how rapid the turnover is from VLDL to smaller ApoB containing lipoproteins in LMHR, thats because there is high demand for triglycerides.   
- Triglycerides turnover: Triglycerides (fats in the blood) are released from the liver as part of VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein). In LMHRs, these triglycerides are quickly used up by the bodyâ€™s tissues, leading to a rapid conversion of VLDL into smaller particles like LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein).   
- High demand for triglycerides: The body in this state requires more energy from fat, which means triglycerides are rapidly taken up and used as fuel. This fast turnover results in relatively stable triglyceride levels in the blood despite increased fat intake.   
   
Saturated fat reduces clearance because it lowers LDL receptors, but has less impact on clearance than BMI (we have strong data on this - studies - [https://openheart.bmj.com/content/openhrt/5/2/e000871.full.pdf](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/openhrt/5/2/e000871.full.pdf), [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170664](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170664) )   
The 2024 study - [https://learn.acc.org/Listing/Carbohydrate-Restriction-Induced-Elevations-in-LDL-Cholesterol-and-Atherosclerosis-The-KETO-Trial-JACC-Advances-August-2024-21197](https://learn.acc.org/Listing/Carbohydrate-Restriction-Induced-Elevations-in-LDL-Cholesterol-and-Atherosclerosis-The-KETO-Trial-JACC-Advances-August-2024-21197) - found no correlation between ApoB and plaque in vessels in LMHR people on ketodiet (measured on CT)
