# chole   
- proteín ktorý môžeme násjť na chilomirkónoch, v chilomikrón remnantoch, VLDL a ILDL   
- ApoE slúži ako ligand (molekula, ktorá sa viaže na receptor), ktorý je rozpoznávaný špecifickými receptormi na pečeňových bunkách, ako je LDL receptor (LDLR) a LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1)   
- ApoE je hlavný ligand pre čistenie častíc ApoB   
- Bez dostatočného množstva ApoE alebo ak je proces viazania narušený, zvyšky chylomikrónov a častice obsahujúce ApoB sa môžu hromadiť v krvi!   
   
**Absorbcia a žlč (Biliary micelles)**   
- každý má absorbable pool of cholesterol v gut lumen   
- Cholesterol:   
    - Exogenous origin (ingested)   
    - Endogenous origin (synthesized in the body, got back to the liver, liver is trying to get rid of it, sending it to the gut in a hope that it can be excreted, but it will now become a part of absorbable pool of cholesterol)   
        - 80 % cholesterol v našom tenkom čreve pochádza z endogénnych zdrojov   
            - to je dôved prečo je ťažké zvýšiť cholesterol jedením   
- cholesterol je transportovaný v billiary micelles   
    - Rozdiel oproti lipoproteínom:   
        - **Biliary micelles:** composed of bile salts, phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides   
        - **Lipoproteins:** composed of apolipoproteins, phospholipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipids   
- Niemann-Pick C1-Like1 (NMPC1L1)   
- ABCG5/G8 transporter — efflux transporter   
- **ACAT** — Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase — enzým ktorý zmení UC na CE   
    - enzým má oveľa väčšiu afinitu k cholesterolu než k fytosterolom!   
   
**Výroba cholesterolu z mastných kyselín v enterocyte:**   
- **AcetylCoA** — rozloží mastné kyseliny   
- je konvertovaný na **mevalonate** /ENZYME\_CATALYZED   
- je konvertovaný na **isoprenoidy** (je vytvorený kondenzáciou mevalonate) /ENZYME\_CATALYZED   
- sú konvertované na **squalene** (je vytvorený kondenzáciou isoprenoidov)   
- squalene je konvertovaný na **squalene epoxid** cez enzým squalene peroxidáza  /ENZYME\_CATALYZED   
- squalene epoxid je konvertovaný na **lanosterol** (cyklizácia squalene epoxide)  /ENZYME\_CATALYZED   
- cholesterol (removal of methyl groups and formation of double bonds) /ENZYME\_CATALYZED   
   
**Chylomikrón (energia)**   
- na chilomikróne sú proteíny ktoré sú ligandy pre lipoproteín lipázu (TG-dissolving enzyme)   
- TG sa hydrolizujú (mastná kyselina sa odtrhne z glycerolu)   
- chylomikrón vypustí mastné kyseliny   
   
**HDL**   
- CETP — penis z ktorého HDL cucá cholesterol a TG z LDL (molekuala cholesterolu ide z HDL do LDL ale molekula TG ide z LDL do HDL)   
   
**Synthesis**   
- 2 Pathways — Bloch and Kandutsch-Russell pathway.   
1. **Bloch pathway:** This pathway is also known as the "classical" or "mevalonate" pathway:   
- Acetyl-CoA → HMG-CoA → mevalonate → isopentenyl pyrophosphate → squalene → lanosterol → cholesterol   
2. **Kandutsch-Russell pathway:** This pathway is also known as the "alternative" or "desmosterol" pathway:   
- Lanosterol → 24,25-dihydrolanosterol → desmosterol → cholesterol   
   
The Bloch pathway is the major pathway of cholesterol synthesis in most cells, while the Kandutsch-Russell pathway is more prominent in certain tissues, such as the brain and testes.   
**Ak chcem vedieť či absorbujem veľa, tak checknem:**   
- **Campesterol**   
- **Sitosterol**   
- **Cholestanol**   
   
**Ak chcem vedieť či syntetizujem veľa, tak checknem:**   
- **Lanosterol**   
    - direct precursor in the pathway that converts squalene to cholesterol in the liver   
- **Desmosterol**   
- Ak chceš vedieť či syntetizuješ too much, zmeraj Desmosterol laj lanosterol (ak I alebo II elevated, si oversynthesátor) (nemeraj iba cholesterol lebo ho môžeš overabsorbeovať a to nemá nič s choklesterolovou syntézou)   
   
**Mozog — syntéza**   
- mozgomiečšny mok — desmosterol — v sére je dosť podstatným markerom   
- ApoE fills with cholesterol in the astrocyte (type of glial cell)   
- LIPOPROTEINS DO NOT TRAVEL IN BLOOD IN THE BRAIN, THEY TRAVEL IN BRAIN CONNECTIVE TISSUE (MATRISOME) — **matrisome** refers to the complete set of **extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins** and **associated factors** that form and interact with the extracellular matrix within a tissue or organ   
- neurons have LDL receptors (or LDL-receptor related portein) that grabs particle and pulls it into the neuron   
   
**Statíny**   
- dva statíny — lipofilné a hydrofilné   
   
**Lipophilic Statins:**   
- Examples: Atorvastatin (Lipitor), Simvastatin, Lovastatin, and Fluvastatin.   
- Characteristics:   
    - These statins are fat-soluble, meaning they can more easily cross cell membranes, including those of muscle and other tissues.   
    - They have a broader distribution in the body, potentially affecting tissues outside the liver.   
    - Sometimes, their higher tissue penetration is associated with a higher incidence of muscle-related side effects (myopathy or muscle pain).   
   
**Hydrophilic Statins:**   
- Examples: Rosuvastatin and Pravastatin.   
- Characteristics:   
    - These are water-soluble, so they are more selective for the liver (decrease hepatic pool of cholesterol)   
    - They tend to have fewer muscle-related side effects compared to lipophilic statins because they do not easily cross into other tissues.   
   
**1. Traditional Statins: Depleting the Hepatic Pool of Cholesterol**   
- Mechanism: Statins inhibit an enzyme called HMG-CoA reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that synthesizes cholesterol in the liver.   
    - By blocking this enzyme, statins reduce the production of cholesterol in the liver. This results in a depleted hepatic pool of cholesterol.   
    - In response, the liver increases the expression of LDL receptors on its surface to compensate for the decreased cholesterol synthesis. These receptors bind to LDL particles in the blood and internalize them into the liver cells   
    - As a result, the removal of LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream increases, leading to lower LDL-C levels in the blood.   
- Effect on LDL Cholesterol   
    - Statins are effective in reducing overall LDL cholesterol levels by increasing LDL clearance from the blood   
    - They also reduce the overall risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks, due to their role in lowering LDL and potentially stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques.   
   
**Iné inhibítory**   
**PCSK9 Inhibitors: Increasing LDL Receptor Availability**   
- Mechanism:   
    - PCSK9 is a protein produced by the liver that binds to LDL receptors on liver cells. When PCSK9 binds to an LDL receptor, it causes the receptor to be degraded rather than recycled.   
    - PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that block the action of PCSK9. By inhibiting PCSK9, these drugs prevent the degradation of LDL receptors on the surface of liver cells.   
    - This leads to a significant increase in the clearance of LDL cholesterol from the blood, further lowering LDL-C levels.   
- Effect on LDL Cholesterol:   
    - PCSK9 inhibitors can lower LDL cholesterol levels dramatically, sometimes by 50-60% or more when combined with statins.   
    - They are often used in patients who either do not respond sufficiently to statins or have familial hypercholesterolemia (a genetic condition with very high cholesterol levels).   
   
**How They Work Together**   
- Combined Therapy: Often, PCSK9 inhibitors are used in combination with statins for a synergistic effect—statins reduce cholesterol synthesis while PCSK9 inhibitors maximize LDL receptor availability. This combination is particularly effective in individuals with very high cholesterol levels or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).   
   
**Ezetimibe:**   
- blocks Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) transporter   
   
**Bile Acid Sequestrants:**   
- Examples: Cholestyramine, Colestipol, and Colesevelam.   
- Mechanism: These drugs bind bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption.   
- Effect: The liver must use more cholesterol to produce new bile acids, thus depleting the hepatic cholesterol pool and upregulating LDL receptors to pull more LDL from the bloodstream.   
- These are less commonly used today due to gastrointestinal side effects and the availability of more effective alternatives.   
   
**Bempedoic Acid:**   
- Mechanism: It inhibits an enzyme called ATP citrate lyase, which is involved in the cholesterol synthesis pathway upstream of HMG-CoA reductase.   
- Effect: Similar to statins, it reduces cholesterol synthesis in the liver, leading to upregulation of LDL receptors.   
- It can be used in patients who are intolerant to statins.   
   
**Fibrates (Primarily Targeting Triglycerides):**   
- Examples: Fenofibrate and Gemfibrozil.   
- Mechanism: They activate a nuclear receptor called PPAR-alpha, which affects lipid metabolism.   
- Effect: While fibrates primarily reduce triglycerides, they can also have modest effects on increasing HDL and in some cases, lowering LDL.   
- They are not used as primary agents for lowering LDL cholesterol but may be part of a combination therapy.   
   
**Niacin (Nicotinic Acid):**   
- Mechanism: Reduces liver production of VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein), which eventually leads to a reduction in LDL cholesterol.   
- Effect: It has been shown to increase HDL (high-density lipoprotein) and lower triglycerides, but its use has declined due to side effects like flushing and lack of clear cardiovascular benefits when added to statins.
