# Cheap and Anonymous Genome Sequencing Guide    
This guide explains how to **cheaply and anonymously** obtain and analyze your genome sequence. It’s designed mostly for Central Europeans (e.g., Czech Republic, Slovakia) who value privacy and want to explore health-related genetic data.   
## Step 1: Order AncestryDNA Kit Anonymously   
- **Why AncestryDNA?** Provides raw DNA data (text file) for analysis, not just ancestry info.   
- **Cost**: ~€99–€120 per kit (check [AncestryDNA website](https://www.ancestry.com/) for current pricing; shipping to Central Europe ~€20–€40).   
- **How to Order Anonymously**:   
    - **Limit**: Ancestry allows max 3 kits per order. For more, split orders and use different shipping addresses.   
    - Order it to another person/friend who will receive the 3 kits.   
   
## Step 2: Collect and Send DNA Sample   
- **Process**:   
    - Receive the kit from another person/friend, spit into the provided tube (per instructions), and seal it.   
    - Register the kit on [AncestryDNA](https://www.ancestry.com/) using your fake name and disposable email. No ID verification needed.   
    - Ship the kit to Ancestry’s Ireland address (included in kit instructions). At the post office, provide a fake return address if asked (e.g., “Jana Nováková, Náměstí 123, Praha”).   
   
## Step 3: Download Raw DNA Data   
- **Access Results**:   
    - Wait ~6–8 weeks for AncestryDNA to process your sample. Log into your account (with fake credentials) to view results.   
    - Download raw DNA data (a `.txt`  file) from the “Settings” > “Download Raw DNA Data” section. Save this securely.   
- **Delete Data (Optional)**: For maximum privacy, delete your DNA test from AncestryDNA after downloading (Settings > “Delete Test”). This removes your data from their servers, though research-consented data may persist if you opted in.   
   
## Step 4: Analyze Your DNA Data   
Upload your raw DNA data to either **Promethease** or **FoundMyFitness** for health insights. Pay anonymously using Monero via Stealths.net.   
### Option 1: Promethease   
- **Website**:  [promethease.com](https://promethease.com/)   
- **Cost**: $12 USD per report (additional files $4 each).   
- **Payment**:   
    - Use [Stealths.net](https://stealths.net/)  to pay with Monero. Load $20+ to cover the $5 Stealths fee (e.g., $12 report + $5 fee = $17 total).   
    - Create a disposable email for Promethease registration.   
- **How It Works**:   
    - Upload your AncestryDNA `.txt`  file. Promethease matches it to SNPedia, generating a report with thousands of SNPs (e.g., health risks, traits).   
    - Download the report (ZIP file) within **45 days**, as it’s deleted afterward. Raw DNA data is deleted after **24 hours**.   
- **Pros**:   
    - Comprehensive: Analyzes 19,000+ SNPs, including health and traits.   
    - Privacy-friendly: Short data retention (24 hours for raw data, 45 days for report).   
    - Geeky: Ideal for biohackers who enjoy digging into raw data (in [this Git file](https://github.com/NodeVonHydra/Health-Medicine-Physiology-Interesting-Info/blob/main/Ancestry%20and%20Promethease%20-%20how%20to%20navigate.md) I describe in detail how to navigate Promethease and how to filter individual parameters).   
- **Cons**:   
    - Technical and overwhelming: Reports are raw, with no medical advice. Requires filtering (e.g., Magnitude >3, ClinVar) to find relevant SNPs.   
    - No direct health recommendations; you must research SNPs yourself.   
- **Best For**: Privacy-conscious users and geeks who want detailed SNP data and are comfortable with self-analysis.   
   
### Option 2: FoundMyFitness   
- **Website**:  [foundmyfitness.com](https://foundmyfitness.com/)   
- **Cost**:   
    - One-time report: $25 USD, but you can just pay $15 month subscription, insert your genome, wait few seconds for a report and then cancel the subscription.   
- **Payment**:   
    - Use [Stealths.net](https://stealths.net/) with Monero. Load $20 for the $15 plan ($15 + $5 fee) or $30 for the one-time report ($25 + $5 fee).   
    - Use a disposable email for registration.   
- **How It Works**:   
    - Upload your AncestryDNA `.txt`  file. FoundMyFitness analyzes curated SNPs (e.g., MTHFR, ApoE) for health, nutrition, and longevity.   
    - Download a PDF report (retain permanently) with actionable insights.   
- **Pros**:   
    - User-friendly: Curated, digestible reports with dietary/lifestyle tips.   
    - Actionable: Suggests foods and supplements for your genetic profile.   
- **Cons**:   
    - Limited scope: Fewer SNPs than Promethease.   
    - Outdated analyzer (no updates since ~2022), unclear data retention policy.   
- **Best For**: Users seeking simple, health-focused insights with minimal effort.   
   
## Step 5: Extra Privacy Tips   
- **Use a VPN**: Hide your IP address when ordering, registering, or uploading data (e.g., ProtonVPN, Mullvad).   
- **Data Security**: Store raw DNA data and reports on an encrypted drive. Delete online data from AncestryDNA and FoundMyFitness after downloading (contact FoundMyFitness support for data deletion: [sprivacyrequests@foundmyfitness.com](mailto:usprivacyrequests@foundmyfitness.com)).   
- **Avoid Ancestry Features**: Don’t enable DNA matches or public family trees to prevent linking to your real identity.   
   
   
Enjoy your genome and stay healthy!
