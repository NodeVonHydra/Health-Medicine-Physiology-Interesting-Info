# Melatonin and Melanopsin   
## **Melanopsin & Light Detection**   
- **Melanopsin** is a **blue light-sensitive** photopigment in **intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)**.   
- It detects daylight and signals the **suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)** in the hypothalamus, which controls **circadian rhythms** and **seasonal cycles**.   
   
## **Melatonin & Its Role in Reproduction**   
- **Melatonin** is secreted by the **pineal gland**, primarily in response to darkness.   
- More darkness (shorter days) → **More melatonin** (Winter)   
- More light (longer days) → **Less melatonin** (Summer)   
- Melatonin plays a crucial role in regulating **seasonal breeding** because it influences the secretion of **gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)**.   
   
## **Gonadotropins & Reproduction**   
- **Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)** is released from the hypothalamus and stimulates the **pituitary gland** to secrete:   
    - **Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**   
    - **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**   
        - These hormones regulate **testosterone, estrogen, ovulation, and spermatogenesis**, which influence **breeding behavior**.   
        - **Melatonin inhibits GnRH secretion**, reducing gonadotropin levels and suppressing reproduction in long-day breeders (e.g., horses, birds).   
   
## **Dopamine & Seasonal Reproduction**   
- **Dopamine** is a neuromodulator involved in **motivation, reward, and reproductive behavior**.   
- In many species:   
    - **High dopamine** is linked to increased sexual behavior and pair bonding.   
    - **Low dopamine** can suppress reproductive behaviors.   
- Dopamine interacts with **melatonin** and **gonadotropins**, modulating the reproductive axis.   
- In some animals, less **melatonin can change dopamine activity**, affecting mating drive and parental behavior.   
   
## **Seasonal Breeding & Photoperiodism**   
- **Long-day breeders (e.g., horses, birds, rodents)**   
    - Breed in spring/summer when **melatonin is low** (due to longer daylight).   
    - This allows **increased GnRH, gonadotropins, and reproductive activity**.   
- **Short-day breeders (e.g., sheep, goats, deer)**   
    - Breed in fall/winter when **melatonin is high**.   
    - In these species, **melatonin actually stimulates GnRH release**, triggering the breeding season.
