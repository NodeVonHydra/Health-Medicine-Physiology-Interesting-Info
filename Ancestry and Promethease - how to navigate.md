# Ancestry a Promethease   
*How to use it:*   
- Peter pulled up Prometheus on his computer to give listeners a sense of what he does with it   
- He will first look at results with a negative connotation   
    - Then he filters for magnitude:   
        - He’s going to raise the magnitude threshold to 1.5 to 2 or something like that, maybe 1.8   
    - Filter for publications:   
        - It ranges from zero to 127 on this particular set Peter is viewing so he’s going to set it at 10—he wants to see at least 10 publications before he pays attention.   
    - Filter for Frequency: He wants to look at something that has a frequency of more than 10 to 20.   
    - Looking at the filtered data now:   
        - This sample report now says, “You have 2X the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. You carry one copy of E3, one copy of E4.”   
            - That comes with a bad magnitude of 3.5   
            - It has lots of publications on that   
        - But then there are some other things in here that “kind of ridiculous”, for instance, the “lack empathy” SNP which is rs53576   
            - Magnitude 2.8   
            - 53 publications on this   
            - It’s a silencing of a G to an A in the oxytocin receptor   
            - Kind of interesting, but it’s not really going to change anything you do   
        - Diabetes risk: Here’s another one that’s a magnitude 2.7 that increases your risk of gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes   
    - Peter will typically go through the same exercise on the good side   
        - The first thing that pops up is a magnitude 2.1   
        - If you have this gene, you’ve got a 60% reduction in HIV viral load   
- In short, if you do a genetic test, Peter thinks it’s worth the extra cost
to analyze your data on the Prometheus website (but still recommends
talking with a doctor about your results)
