# Ancestry and Promethease   
*How to use it:*   
 
- First look at results with a negative connotation   
    - Then filter for magnitude:   
        - Raise the magnitude threshold to 1.5 to 2 or something like that, maybe 1.8   
    - Filter for publications:   
        - Set it at 10 if you want to see at least 10 publications before he pays attention.   
    - Filter for Frequency: if you want to look at something that has a frequency of more than 10 to 20. Frequency refers to the percentage of people in a chosen population (e.g., CEU for European/Caucasian, ASW for African ancestry in the Southwest) who share a specific genotype for a given single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP).   
    - Looking at the filtered data now:   
        - This sample report now says, “You have 2X the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. You carry one copy of E3, one copy of E4.”   
            - That comes with a bad magnitude of 3.5   
        - But then there are some other things in here that “kind of ridiculous”, for instance, the “lack empathy” SNP which is rs53576 (Magnitude 2.8, 53 publications...)
