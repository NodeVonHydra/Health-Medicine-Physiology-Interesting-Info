# How to navigate in Promethease parameters (DNA sequencing)?   
Promethease is a tool that analyzes genetic data to provide insights into health, traits, and ancestry based on SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data. Below is a guide to understanding and navigating key parameters in Promethease reports:   
- **Magnitude**:   
    - **Definition**: A subjective measure of the significance or interest of a genetic variant, ranging from 0 to 10.   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Higher values (e.g., 4–10) indicate more significant findings, such as strong associations with health conditions or traits.   
        - Filter by magnitude in the Promethease interface to prioritize notable results (e.g., set a threshold of ≥3 for impactful variants).   
        - Focus on high-magnitude SNPs for actionable insights, but cross-reference with medical literature or professionals.   
- **Frequency**:   
    - **Definition**: The prevalence of a specific allele or genotype in a population, often expressed as a percentage.   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Check the frequency column to understand how common a variant is in the general population or specific ethnic groups.   
        - Low-frequency variants (<1%) may indicate rare conditions or unique traits.   
        - Use frequency filters to focus on rare or common variants, depending on your research goals.   
- **Repute**:   
    - **Definition**: Indicates whether a variant is considered "Good" (beneficial), "Bad" (potentially harmful), or "Not Set" (neutral or unclear).   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Sort by "Good" to identify protective variants or "Bad" for risk-associated SNPs.   
        - Be cautious with "Not Set" results, as they may lack sufficient research to determine impact.   
        - Cross-check with referenced studies for context on repute assignments.   
- **Summary**:   
    - **Definition**: A brief description of the SNP’s associated condition, trait, or effect.   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Read summaries for a quick understanding of the variant’s relevance.   
        - Click on linked SNPs or references (e.g., SNPedia or PubMed) for detailed research.   
        - Use keyword searches within summaries to find specific conditions (e.g., "diabetes" or "lactose intolerance").   
- **Chromosome and Position**:   
    - **Definition**: The location of the SNP on a specific chromosome (e.g., Chr1:123456).   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Use this to cross-reference with other genetic databases or tools (e.g., dbSNP or Ensembl).   
        - Helps in understanding the genomic context and nearby genes.   
- **Genotype**:   
    - **Definition**: Your specific allele combination for the SNP (e.g., AA, AG, GG).   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Compare your genotype to the reference allele to determine if you carry risk or protective variants.   
        - Note homozygous (e.g., AA) vs. heterozygous (e.g., AG) states, as they may affect expression or risk levels.   
- **Gene**:   
    - **Definition**: The gene associated with the SNP, if applicable.   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Click on the gene name to explore its function or related conditions on SNPedia or other databases.   
        - Useful for understanding the biological pathway affected by the variant.   
- **References**:   
    - **Definition**: Links to scientific studies or databases (e.g., PubMed, SNPedia) supporting the SNP’s annotation.   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Follow links to verify the evidence behind a finding.   
        - Prioritize peer-reviewed studies for reliability and avoid over-relying on preliminary data.   
- **Filters and Sorting**:   
    - **Definition**: Tools in the Promethease interface to organize results.   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Use filters for magnitude, frequency, or repute to narrow down results.   
        - Sort by categories like "Medical Conditions," "Traits," or "Drug Response" to focus on specific areas.   
        - Export data for offline analysis or consultation with genetic counselors.   
- **Clinical Significance**:   
    - **Definition**: Indicates if the variant is classified as pathogenic, benign, or uncertain in clinical databases (e.g., ClinVar).   
    - **Navigation**:   
        - Focus on "Pathogenic" or "Likely Pathogenic" variants for health risks.   
        - Use this parameter to prioritize findings for discussion with healthcare providers.   
   
## Tips for Effective Navigation   
- **Start Broad, Then Narrow**: Begin with high-magnitude or low-frequency variants, then drill down into specific genes or conditions.   
- **Cross-Reference**: Use external resources like SNPedia, ClinVar, or PubMed to validate findings.   
- **Consult Professionals**: For significant findings (e.g., high-magnitude, pathogenic variants), seek advice from genetic counselors or doctors.   
- **Save and Revisit**: Download your report to track changes or revisit as new research emerges.
