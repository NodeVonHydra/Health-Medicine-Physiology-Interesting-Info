- Many things are responsible for fight or flight, but for "freezing" it's pronounced PAG (periaqueductal gray - the region in the brain responsible for analgesic opioid action)   
    - Hence, the natural anesthetic before death   
- Locus Coreuleus - a small nucleus located in the bridge of the brainstem that contains more than 50% of all noradrenergic neurons in the brain   
    - is the primary source of the neuromodulator noradrenaline, but also activates epi/norepinephrine   
        - Hence, a very important centre for the panic response   
   
   
- NMDA receptor - something like "update" model after SGD/batch gradient descent in AI - controls associations and learning (directly on this is the keytag)   
    - Long term use of ketamine alters the rhythm of cortical activity (it's normally measured in Hrtz)   
   
   
- Kava kava increases both GABA and dopamine   
- MDMA brutally increases oxytocin
