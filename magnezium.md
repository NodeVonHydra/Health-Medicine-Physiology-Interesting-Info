# Magn√©zium   
- it is a cation   
- NMDA antagonist and GABA agonist   
- it is mostly consumed by bones   
    - Osteoblasts and osteoclasts   
        - If you have a lot of imbalance towards the clasts, you have osteopenia and then you have osteoporosis   
   
   
- magnesium directly regulates bone tissue formation via up/downregulation of blasts and clasts and indirectly via calcium PTH (parathyroid hormone) and vit. D   
- is involved in insulin metabolism   
- magnesium measurment from blood is not a good indicator of total body magnesium   
    - If you already test, much better to test urine   
   
   
## Migraines   
- Magnesium inhibits glutamate excitatory pathways of the NMDA receptor   
- Surprisingly, migraines are associated with more excitation :)   
    - Hence; the greater the magnesium deficiency, the greater the excitation and the greater the likelihood of a migraine   
    - For migraine, oral magnesium will help only as a prevention, for acute treatment only intravenously (even 3 grams)
