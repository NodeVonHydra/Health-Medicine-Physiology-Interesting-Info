**Forms of B3**   
1. **Niacin (Nicotinic Acid)**: This is the most common form of Vitamin B3. It's a water-soluble vitamin that's found in many foods, including meat, fish, and whole grains.   
2. **Nicotinamide (NAM**): This form of Vitamin B3 is also known as Niacinamide. It's similar to Niacin, but it has a slightly different chemical structure. Nicotinamide is often used in supplements and is considered to be a more gentle form of Vitamin B3.   
3. **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR)**: This is a riboside form of Nicotinamide, which means it's attached to a ribose sugar molecule. NR is a more recent form of Vitamin B3 that's been shown to have a number of health benefits, including increasing NAD+ levels.   
4. **Inositol Hexanicotinate (IHN)**: This is a slow-release form of Vitamin B3 that's designed to reduce the risk of skin flushing and other side effects associated with high doses of Niacin.   
5. **Nicotinic Acid Mononucleotide (NAMN)**: This is a form of Vitamin B3 that's similar to NR, but it's not as well-studied.   
   
## **NAD+ Precursors**   
- NR (Nicotinamide Riboside)   
- Niacin (Vitamin B3) - converted to NMN   
- Nicotinamide (NAM) - not as effective as NMN or NR in increasing NAD+ levels   
- NA (Nicotinic Acid)   
- Niacin
- Tryptophan
