# Cholesterol - Lp(a)   
## What is Lp(a) + Genetics   
- **Apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a))**: This is a unique protein structurally similar to plasminogen, a protein involved in blood clotting. Apo(a) is the key protein attached to Lp(a).   
- **Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a))**: This is a complex lipoprotein particle that contains an LDL-like core bound to apolipoprotein B-100, as well as an attached apo(a) protein. Elevated levels of Lp(a) are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases due to its pro-inflammatory and pro-atherosclerotic properties.   
   
   
1 in 5 people have genes for producing Lp(a) — Your liver either produces Lp(a) or not it depends on whether you inherited the right genes.   
Lp(a) is indeed assembled in the liver, with two main components joining together during its production: **Apolipoprotein B-100 (ApoB)** and **Apolipoprotein(a)**. Here’s a more detailed look at the process:   
   
1. **Production of ApoB and Primordial LDL Particle**: The liver first synthesizes ApoB-100, a large protein that is essential in forming LDL (low-density lipoprotein) particles. This ApoB-containing particle, sometimes referred to as a “primordial LDL,” provides a structural platform for the subsequent addition of other components.   
2. **Apo(a) Attachment to ApoB**: Within the hepatocyte (liver cell), Apolipoprotein(a) or Apo(a)—a unique protein that has multiple kringle (loop-like) domains—is produced separately. It attaches to the ApoB-100 component of the primordial LDL particle through a disulfide bond. This linkage forms the distinct Lp(a) molecule.   
3. **Secretion into Bloodstream**: Once Apo(a) is joined to ApoB, the liver secretes the fully assembled Lp(a) particle into the bloodstream.   
   
## A little bit of high school biology :)   
Proteins are synthesized in the **endoplasmic reticulum (ER)**, where **ribosomes**, the cell’s protein-making machinery, play a central role. Here’s how it works:   
1. **Ribosomes in the ER**: Ribosomes are located on the rough ER (giving it a “rough” appearance). These ribosomes translate mRNA sequences, which are the instructions from DNA, into chains of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.   
2. **Amino Acid Assembly**: Ribosomes gather and link amino acids in a specific order based on the mRNA sequence, creating a polypeptide chain that will eventually fold into a functional protein or peptide.   
3. **Protein Maturation**: After the initial assembly, proteins often undergo further modifications in the ER and are transported to the **Golgi apparatus** or other cell areas for final processing, folding, and packaging.   
   
   
But how does the ribosomes do that? Who tells them to do that? It's the DNA, obviously, which is in our nucleus. So if you inherited Lp(a) gene, and of course we have two alleles of it, one from dad and one from mom.   
So if you have inherited the wrong type of genes to make Lp(a), it gets translated into messenger RNA and this goes over to the endoplasmic reticulum and it can be transcripted into protein synthesis.   
### Inheritance   
Each individual inherits one Lp(a) allele from each parent, meaning there are typically two distinct types or **isoforms** of Lp(a) in most people, one from each parent. These isoforms may vary significantly in size and structure because the gene that encodes apolipoprotein(a) (the unique protein in Lp(a)) is highly variable, resulting in different isoform sizes. The combination of isoforms can influence overall Lp(a) levels in the bloodstream.   
## Lp(a), Plasminogen and Kringles   
Lp(a) is thought to play a role in hemocoagulation (blood clotting). Lp(a) has structural similarities to plasminogen, a protein involved in breaking down blood clots. However, unlike plasminogen, Lp(a) doesn’t help dissolve clots; instead, it may inhibit fibrinolysis, or the process of breaking down clots. This inhibition could increase the risk of thrombosis (clot formation), particularly in people with high Lp(a) levels. Elevated Lp(a) is thus considered a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, as it may promote clot formation in blood vessels.   
   
Plasminogen and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) are structurally similar in that both have domains called “kringles”.   
   
More about Kringles:   
   
Kringles are structural protein domains that primarily participate in protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions. They are characterized by a distinctive looped, triple-disulfide bridge configuration, giving them a unique folded appearance reminiscent of a Danish pastry, which they are named after ("kringle" in Danish). Both lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), and plasminogen contain kringle domains, but their roles and specific interactions differ in crucial ways that impact cardiovascular health and blood clotting.   
### Kringles in Lp(a) and Plasminogen   
1. **Plasminogen** : This is a key enzyme precursor in the fibrinolytic system, which is responsible for breaking down blood clots. Plasminogen contains five kringle domains (Kringle 1 to Kringle 5). These domains are involved in binding to various ligands, including fibrin, which is the major component of blood clots. The interaction of plasminogen's kringle domains with fibrin targets plasminogen to clots, where it is converted into plasmin, thus promoting clot breakdown.   
2. **Lp(a)** : Lp(a) is structurally similar to LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and is linked to apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], which resembles plasminogen in its kringle structure. Lp(a) specifically has two types: kringle IV and kringle V. Apo(a) includes multiple kringle IV domains that are broken down into ten subtypes, with kringle IV type-2 (KIV-2) being of particular interest due to its genetic variability.   
   
What makes Lp(a) problematic is its high number of kringle IV type-2 (KIV-2) repeats, which varies genetically between individuals (ranging from just a few repeats to 50 in some cases). This variation in KIV-2 repeats impacts the size of Lp(a) and affects its function.    
This variability has direct implications:   
1. **Size and Density of Lp(a)** : The number of KIV-2 repeats affects the size of the apo(a) component of Lp(a). An increased number of KIV-2 repeats results in a larger apo(a) and hence a larger Lp(a) molecule. Typically, larger Lp(a) molecules with more KIV-2 repeats are associated with lower plasma concentrations of Lp(a), thought to be due to a slower rate of synthesis or secretion.   
2. **Cardiovascular Risk** : Oddly, while larger Lp(a) molecules are present in lower concentrations, smaller Lp(a) molecules (with fewer KIV-2 repeats) are usually more abundant in the blood and are associated with higher cardiovascular risk. This is due to their higher plasma levels and their more atherogenic nature, likely because they are more easily able to penetrate the arterial wall and promote lipid accumulation and inflammation.   
3. **Imitation of Plasminogen** : Lp(a)'s structural similarity to plasminogen, particularly in the kringle domains, allows it to competitively inhibit plasminogen’s binding to fibrin, thereby adversely affecting clot dissolution. This property of Lp(a) contributes further to cardiovascular risk, not just through atherogenesis but also by potentially promoting thrombosis.   
   
   
The kringle IV type-2 (KIV-2) domain in Lp(a) varies greatly, with individuals inheriting between 1 and about 50 KIV-2 repeats in their Lp(a) gene. This variability affects the molecular weight and size of Lp(a), resulting in either high-molecular-weight (more KIV-2 repeats) or low-molecular-weight (fewer KIV-2 repeats) forms. Low-molecular-weight Lp(a) has been associated with a higher cardiovascular risk because it often leads to higher plasma concentrations of Lp(a), increasing its likelihood of interfering with blood clot breakdown and contributing to atherosclerosis.   
## Measurment of risk   
   
If you make a big isoform of Lp(a), Lp(a) concentration will be much lower and of course your risk will be much lower.   
Why? Typically, when apo(a) has more kringle IV repeats, it results in a larger apo(a) and consequently a larger Lp(a) molecule. Larger Lp(a) molecules tend to be synthesized more slowly by the liver. This reduced rate of production leads to lower circulating levels of Lp(a) in the blood.   
Also, you can measure ApoB in mass, that means the milligrams per deciliter, but you need to measure the molar concentration of Lp(a) because it has different peptides. In case of ApoB, the ApoB particle has just one peptide so that's why it doesn't matter.   
## Treatment   
The truth is that we don't have any information about how Lp is cleared. So if we want to prevent the cardiovascular disease in lower Lp, we need to decrease production.   
   
There are also some methods how we can prevent the marriage of Lp to primordial lipoprotein. So even if the liver is synthesized, you can prevent the marriage.   
### 1. Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs)   
ASOs are short, synthetic strands of nucleic acids designed to bind to the messenger RNA (mRNA) of apo(a). By binding to the mRNA, ASOs can effectively prevent the translation of the apo(a) protein, thus inhibiting its synthesis. This, in turn, prevents the formation of Lp(a) since there is no apo(a) available to bind to LDL. A specific ASO called "Olpasiran" is being investigated for this purpose and has shown the potential to significantly reduce plasma Lp(a) levels.   
### 2. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)   
Similar in concept to ASOs, siRNA works by degrading the mRNA of apo(a) before it can be translated into protein. An example of an siRNA-based treatment is inclisiran, which targets PCSK9 mRNA but could theoretically be adapted to target apo(a) mRNA.   
### 3. Apo(a) Ligands   
Developing specific ligands that can bind to apo(a) and inhibit its ability to associate with LDL is another area of interest. This method would involve molecules that specifically target the structural components necessary for apo(a) to bind LDL, thus blocking the formation of Lp(a) without necessarily reducing the synthesis of apo(a).   
### 4. Liver-Directed Therapies   
Approaches that target the liver, where Lp(a) is synthesized, might also be effective. These could include liver-targeted therapies aiming to reduce the overall production of apo(a). Techniques might involve gene editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 to specifically alter the expression or function of the apo(a) gene in hepatic cells.   
### Other methods of treatment — STATINS   
Statins don't interfere with LpA. PCSK9 inhibitors can of course lower LpA. But LpA is commonly treated by statins. Statins can actually a little bit increase the amount of LpA, but it usually lowers the risk by decreasing the ApoB particle numbers.   
And why? Well, because even in people with astronomically high amount of Lp particles, the Lp particles are the minority of the atherosclerotic particles. Lp doesn't bind to LDL receptor, so LDL receptor can recognize the particle as LDL particle, but when you increase the amount of receptors, probably you can have some amount of clearance.   
## Lp(a) and oxidized phospholipids   
### Binding of Lp(a) to Oxidized Phospholipids   
1. **Mechanism of Binding** : Lp(a) binds to oxidized phospholipids via its apo(a) component. Apo(a) contains multiple kringle domains, which are similar to those found in plasminogen. Oxidized phospholipids, which accumulate in zones where LDL has oxidized within artery walls, have a high affinity for these kringle domains.   
2. **Pro-Inflammatory Effects** : Oxidized phospholipids are recognized as pro-inflammatory agents, and their carriage by Lp(a) into arterial plaques can exacerbate local inflammation.   
   
### Lp-PLA2 (Lipoprotein-associated Phospholipase A2)   
- **Function** : Lp-PLA2, also known as lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, is an enzyme that hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids on LDL particles. It is generally associated with LDL and Lp(a) and is considered a marker of vascular inflammation and oxidation.   
- **Role in Cardiovascular Disease** : By breaking down oxidized phospholipids, Lp-PLA2 may generate lysophosphatidylcholine and oxidized free fatty acids, which are pro-inflammatory and could contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Despite this, the exact role of Lp-PLA2 in cardiovascular disease is complex and somewhat controversial; some studies suggest it may contribute to atherosclerosis, while others point to a potential protective role depending on the context.   
- **Drug Target** : Darapladib is a well-known inhibitor of Lp-PLA2 that has been studied in various clinical trials to assess its potential in reducing cardiovascular events. While it effectively lowers Lp-PLA2 activity, results regarding its efficacy in significantly improving cardiovascular outcomes have been mixed.
